    <h5>Parameterizing Branch-and-Bound Search Trees to Learn Branching Policies</h5>
    <p>
        We tackle variable selection in Branch-and-Bound (B&B) for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems, 
seeking policies that generalize across heterogeneous MILPs.
We develop new parameterizations of the candidate variables and of the search trees, and design DNN architectures to handle them.
Our results show that incorporating a search-tree context to modulate branching aids generalization, with better test accuracy and smaller B&B trees.

    We translate the algorithmic question of whether to linearize convex Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming problems (MIQPs) into a classification task, 
    and use machine learning techniques to tackle it. We represent MIQPs and the linearization decision by careful target and feature engineering, 
    designing learning experiments and evaluation metrics. As a practical result, we deploy a SVM regression+classification pipeline deciding on MIQP 
    linearization in the IBM-CPLEX 12.10.0 commercial solver.

    <br>
    Looking at the evolution of a partial branch-and-bound (B&B) tree for a MILP instance, we aim to predict whether the problem will be solved 
    to proven optimality before timing out. We exploit machine learning tools, and summarize time-series information from the 
    MILP resolution process to cast a prediction within a classification framework. Experiments show that a valuable statistical pattern can indeed be learned during B&B optimization, 
    with key predictive features reflecting the know-how and experience of fieldâ€™s practitioners.
  
- **On learning and branching: a survey**<br>

    We survey learning techniques to deal with the two most crucial decisions in the branch-and-bound algorithm for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, 
    namely variable and node selections. We interpret some early contributions in the light of modern learning techniques, 
    and give the details of the recent algorithms that instead explicitly incorporate machine learning paradigms.
