Hi! I am presently based in New York City, where I joined [UN Global Pulse](https://www.unglobalpulse.org) as a **Data Science Research Fellow**. 
Before this I worked as an AI Scientist at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai), 
in the group of [Prof. Chris J. Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/). 
My training is at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and optimization.

[comment]: <> (My research explores the **interplay of discrete optimization and statistical learning**.)

[comment]: <> (You can find my publications [here]&#40;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bfwQSQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao&#41;.)


I did my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en/) as part of the 
Canada Excellence Research Chair in [Data Science for real-time Decision-Making](https://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca), 
under the guidance of [Prof. Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/). 
My [dissertation](https://publications.polymtl.ca/5332/) focused on applying machine learning tools to the algorithmic design of practical optimization 
frameworks like Mixed-Integer Programming. 
Before, I completed Bachelor's and Master's programs in Mathematics at [University of Padova](https://www.math.unipd.it/en/).

[comment]: <> (Alongside MIP, I am also interested in sequential decision‐making, search, representation and generalization issues. )

[comment]: <> (My interdisciplinary training and experiences equipped me with a broad set of skills, ranging from decision-making theory+software to Python development, data manipulation and machine learning. )

These interdisciplinary experiences equipped me with a **broad set of skills**, and I am passionate about **interrogating data**
in search of both meaningful questions and actionable answers. 
I seek opportunities to grow and pair my scientific background and research experience with my desire to make a **positive impact**!

[comment]: <> (Topics that challenge and motivate me everyday are sustainability and the issue of diversity gap in STEM:) 
[comment]: <> (I believe data-driven approaches can provide powerful tools to model and analyze the world we live in, )
[comment]: <> (and I would love that my work could **make a difference for social good**!)

[comment]: <> (Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit]&#40;http://reddit.com&#41;. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.)

[comment]: <> (Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)

This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons]&#40;http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/&#41; and [Academicons]&#40;https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/&#41;, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.)
