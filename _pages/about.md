Hi! I presently work as an **AI Scientist** at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai), 
where I joined the group of [Prof. Chris Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/). 
My research explores the **interplay of discrete optimization and statistical learning**. 

[comment]: <> (You can find my publications [here]&#40;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bfwQSQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao&#41;.)

I did my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en/) | [CERC DS4DM](https://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca), 
under the guidance of [Prof. Andrea Lodi](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca/person/dr-andrea-lodi/). 
My [dissertation](https://publications.polymtl.ca/5332/) focused on applying machine learning tools to the algorithmic design of practical optimization 
frameworks like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP). 
Before, I completed Bachelor's and Master's programs in Mathematics at [University of Padova](https://www.math.unipd.it/en/).

[comment]: <> (Alongside MIP, I am also interested in sequential decision‐making, search, representation and generalization issues. )

[comment]: <> (My interdisciplinary training and experiences equipped me with a broad set of skills, ranging from decision-making theory+software to Python development, data manipulation and machine learning. )

I am passionate about **interrogating data** in search of both meaningful questions and actionable answers. 
Topics that challenge and motivate me everyday are sustainability and the issue of diversity gap in STEM: 
I believe data-driven approaches can provide powerful tools to model and analyze the world we live in, 
and I would love that my work could **make a difference for social good**!
