Hi! I am presently a **Data Scientist** at the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment](https://dse.berkeley.edu), 
at the heart of UC Berkeley. Together with my [team](https://dse.berkeley.edu/people), I work to co-create and develop accessible solutions for the people and the planet.

Before this, I joined [UN Global Pulse](https://www.unglobalpulse.org) in New York City as a Data Science Research Fellow,
contributing ideas, code and new functionalities to multidisciplinary data science efforts for humanitarian response.

My training is at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and optimization. <br>
I worked as an AI Scientist at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) 
in the group of [Prof. Chris J. Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/), and 
did my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en/) as part of the 
Canada Excellence Research Chair in [Data Science for real-time Decision-Making](https://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca), 
under the guidance of [Prof. Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/). 
My [dissertation](https://publications.polymtl.ca/5332/) focused on applying machine learning tools to the algorithmic design of practical optimization 
frameworks like Mixed-Integer Programming. 
Previously, I completed B.Sc. and M.Sc. programs in Mathematics at [University of Padova](https://www.math.unipd.it/en/).

[comment]: <> (You can find my publications [here]&#40;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bfwQSQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao&#41;.)


[comment]: <> (continuous desire to pair her scientific background with making a positive impact.)

[comment]: <> (Alongside MIP, I am also interested in sequential decision‐making, search, representation and generalization issues. )

[comment]: <> (My interdisciplinary training and experiences equipped me with a broad set of skills, ranging from decision-making theory+software to Python development, data manipulation and machine learning. )

These interdisciplinary experiences equipped me with a **broad set of skills**, and I am passionate about **interrogating data**
in search of both meaningful questions and actionable answers. 
I seek opportunities to grow and pair my scientific background and research experience with my desire to make a **positive impact**!

[comment]: <> (Topics that challenge and motivate me everyday are sustainability and the issue of diversity gap in STEM:) 
[comment]: <> (I believe data-driven approaches can provide powerful tools to model and analyze the world we live in, )
[comment]: <> (and I would love that my work could **make a difference for social good**!)

[comment]: <> (Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit]&#40;http://reddit.com&#41;. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.)

[comment]: <> (Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)

This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons]&#40;http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/&#41; and [Academicons]&#40;https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/&#41;, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.)
